Creates a Spring 4 web application with SpringSecurity support. The application uses JavaConfig for both ApplicationContext setup and SpringSecurity. This makes the application more or less XML-Free. ( Except a default web.xml, which is there to avoid FileNotFoundException in some servlet containers).\r\n\r\nApplication contains 3 web pages: index.html, login.html and admin/admin.html. The admin page is a protected resource and can only be seen if you login with an admin user. The public webfolder is not part of the security chain.\r\n\r\n$Username: admin \r\n$Password: password\r\n\r\nNote: This requires a Servlet container that supports Servlet 3.0 API, i.e. Tomcat 7.\r\n\r\n###Instructions to use\r\n```\r\nDownload zip or clone from repo\r\n$ mvn package\r\n$ mvn jetty:run\r\n```\r\nApplication comes with embedded Jetty9 so it can be started directly from the command line.\r\n","google":"UA-39365847-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
